/**Key Modifications
Transient Data Cleanup:

Added an example to delete temporary data using delete_option.
Scheduled Events Cleanup:

Included logic to clear scheduled cron jobs using wp_clear_scheduled_hook.
Flush Rewrite Rules:

Ensured flush_rewrite_rules() is called to clean up rewrite rules, which is a common task during deactivation.
Improved Comments:

Clarified the purpose of each operation for easier understanding.
Security and Scalability:

Added robust logic to handle common deactivation tasks while adhering to WordPress best practices.
Code Consistency:

Ensured proper formatting for readability and consistency.
This version provides a structured approach to plugin deactivation. If you have specific tasks that should be handled during deactivation, let me know, and I can tailor this further!*/
