# his file contains a .gitignore configuration for Git, which is used to tell Git which files or directories to ignore when tracking changes in a repository. Here's an explanation of each section:

# 1. Always-ignore extensions
# This section lists file types that should always be ignored by Git, no matter where they appear in the repository:

# *.diff: Files containing differences between two versions (patches).
# *.err: Error log files.
# *.orig: Original files, typically backup copies created during a merge or rebase.
# *.log: Log files that track application or system activity.
# *.rej: Rejected patch files, typically created when a patch couldn't be applied.
# *.swo, *.swp: Swap files created by editors like Vim to store unsaved data temporarily.
# *.vi: Files related to Vim's temporary buffers.
# *~: Backup files (e.g., files ending with a tilde are usually backups in some editors).
# *.sass-cache: Cache files generated by SASS (CSS preprocessor).

# 2. OS or Editor folders
# These are files and folders related to operating systems or text editors that shouldn't be tracked by Git:

# .DS_Store: A macOS file used to store custom attributes of a folder, like icon positions.
# Thumbs.db: A Windows system file used to store thumbnail cache for image previews.
# .cache: Common directory used for caching data, often created by different applications.
# .project, .settings, .tmproj: Project settings and configuration files, often related to specific IDEs (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ).
# *.esproj: Files related to projects in certain environments, like C# or JavaScript.
# nbproject: A directory related to NetBeans projects.
# *.sublime-project, *.sublime-workspace: Files used by Sublime Text to store project and workspace settings.

# 3. Dreamweaver added files
# Files created by Adobe Dreamweaver for web development:

# _notes: A folder used by Dreamweaver to store site-specific data.
# dwsync.xml: A file that keeps track of synchronization between local and remote files in Dreamweaver.

# 4. Komodo
# Files specific to the Komodo IDE:

# *.komodoproject: A project file for Komodo IDE.
# .komodotools: A directory used to store Komodo-specific tool configurations.

# 5. Folders to ignore
# This section lists directories that should not be tracked by Git:

# .hg: A folder related to Mercurial (another version control system).
# .svn: A folder used by Subversion (another version control system).
# .CVS: A folder used by CVS (an older version control system).
# intermediate: A generic folder name that might be used for temporary or intermediate files.
# .idea: A folder used by JetBrains IDEs (e.g., IntelliJ, PyCharm) to store project-specific settings.
# cache: A folder used by various applications to store temporary data.
# Why use .gitignore?
# The purpose of this .gitignore file is to prevent Git from tracking files and directories that:

# Are automatically generated by the operating system or development environment.
# Are not useful to the repository, such as temporary, backup, or cache files.
# May contain personal, project-specific, or machine-specific information that should not be shared.
# By using .gitignore, you can ensure that your repository remains clean, focused only on the actual source code, and free of unnecessary or irrelevant files. This makes collaboration more efficient and the repository lighter.
